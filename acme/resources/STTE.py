# 2) If the request is attempting to update the stateTransitions attribute, the Receiver shall check if after processing the request, the value of the stateActive attribute of the <state> resource will equal “False”. If not, the receiver shall return a response primitive with a Response Status Code indicating an "OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED" error.

# 3) The Receiver shall check the existence and accessibility of an <action> child resource, if any, referenced by the stateAction attribute of the request. If the referenced <action> child resource does not exist, does not have retrieve privileges for the Originator, or is not a child resource of this <state> resource, then the Receiver shall return a response primitive with a Response Status Code indicating an "INVALID_PROCESS_CONFIGURATION" error.

# 4) The Receiver shall check the existence and accessibility of any <state> resources referenced by the stateTransitions attribute of the request. If any of the referenced <state> child resources do not exist, do not have retrieve privileges for the Originator or are not child resources of the parent <processManagement> resource, then the Receiver shall return a response primitive with a Response Status Code indicating "INVALID_PROCESS_CONFIGURATION" error.

# 5) For any evalCriteria defined in the stateTransitions attribute of the request, the Receiver shall check the existence and accessibility of any resource and attribute referenced by the subject element of the evalCriteria. If any of the referenced resources or attributes do not exist or do not have retrieve privileges for the Originator, then the Receiver shall return a response primitive with a Response Status Code indicating an "INVALID_PROCESS_CONFIGURATION" error.

# 6) For any evalCriteria defined in the stateTransitions attribute of the request, the Receiver shall check the value provided for the threshold element of the evalCriteria attribute is within the value space (as defined in [3]) of the data type of the subject element of the evalCriteria attribute. The Receiver shall also check that the value provided for the operator element of the evalCriteria attribute is a valid value based on Table 6.3.4.2.86-1. If either check fails, the receiver shall return a response primitive with a Response Status Code indicating an "INVALID_PROCESS_CONFIGURATION" error.
