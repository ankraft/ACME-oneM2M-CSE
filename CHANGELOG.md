- [CSE] Changed rcn = modifiedAttributes to the improved definition in the spec: return only those modified attributes that where *not* in the original request, but were modified by the CSE as a result of the request.
- [CSE] Improved transit requests: serialization according to target's preferences.
- [CSE] Changed optionality of and originator assignment to CSR.csi according to TS-0004 spec change.
